## Disclaimer

The Workspace Archiver extension is designed to help you create a snapshot of your codebase that can be easily shared or referenced in generative AI platforms. Before using this extension, please be aware that any code or data you choose to archive may be exposed when shared in such platforms. We strongly advise you to remove or redact any sensitive or proprietary information from your code before archiving and sharing it. The extension itself does not filter or remove sensitive data automatically, so it is your responsibility to ensure that only appropriate content is included in the archive. Use this tool with caution and always prioritize the security and confidentiality of your information.
